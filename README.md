# NeuralNetwork

## What is this repo about?
---
This repo contains all the files with my personal projects and Neural Networks exercises I did while learning. 

All the files are coded avoiding the use of packages and libraries as Tensorflow, Keras, Pythorch...

The aim of this project was to understand the math behind the  process and gain intuition.

1. The files include a NN with one hidden layer with no regularization 
2. A NN with one hidden layer with regularization 
3. Some accesrory modules as *reg-utils.py* , *init_utils.py*, *test_cases.py* with relevant functions in code. This modules were acquired in the DeepLearning course in coursera
